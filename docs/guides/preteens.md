## **Preteens (Ages 9-12)**

### **Conversation 1: “Preparing for Puberty”**
- **Puberty**: Discuss the physical and emotional changes they can expect as they go through puberty.
  - **Example**: “During puberty, your body starts to change to look more like an adult’s. Girls might get their periods, and boys might notice their voice getting deeper.”

- **Sexual Mechanics**: Offer more specific information about sex, explaining that it involves the joining of a penis and a vagina, but that there are also other types of intimate activities.
  - **Example**: “Sex is when a penis goes into a vagina, but people can also show love in other ways by touching or kissing.”

- **Consent**: Stress the importance of both giving and getting clear consent in all situations.
  - **Example**: “It’s important that both people say ‘yes’ and feel comfortable before they do anything physical together. No one should feel pressured.”

### **Conversation 2: “Sexual Health and Safety”**
- **Sexual Health**: Discuss safe sex practices, including contraception methods like condoms and birth control, even if they aren’t sexually active yet.

- **Sexual Photos**: Explain why it’s important not to send or ask for sexual photos, and the dangers associated with them.

- **More Details About Porn**: Discuss why pornography isn’t an accurate portrayal of sex and how it can affect their understanding of relationships.
