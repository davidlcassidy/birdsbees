# **Early Childhood (Age 5 & Under)**

### **Conversation 1: “Your Amazing Body”**
- **Basic Anatomy**: Use the correct names for body parts, including penis, vulva/vagina, nipples, and butt.
  - **Example**: “This is your elbow, and this is your penis/vulva. Just like your arms and legs, these parts have important jobs.”

- **Body Functions**: Explain that different parts of the body have different functions. 
  - **Example**: “Your lungs help you breathe, and your penis/vulva helps you go to the bathroom. All parts of your body work together to keep you healthy.”

- **Conception Basics**: Offer a simple explanation of how babies are made.
  - **Example**: “A baby grows in a special place inside the mommy called the uterus. It starts when a tiny sperm from the daddy joins with a tiny egg from the mommy.”

### **Conversation 2: “Your Body, Your Space”**
- **Personal Space**: Teach them about personal boundaries and respect for their own and others’ space.
  - **Example**: “Everyone has a special space around their body, and you can decide who comes close to you. It’s okay to say ‘no’ if you don’t want to hug someone.”

- **Bodily Agency**: Reinforce that they are in control of their own bodies and shouldn’t feel pressured to engage in physical contact, even with family members.
  - **Example**: “You don’t have to give anyone a hug or kiss if you don’t want to, even if they are family. You can always say, ‘No, thank you.’”

- **Private Parts and Inappropriate Touch**: Explain the concept of private parts—areas covered by underwear—and emphasize that no one should touch or see them unless for medical reasons (with a parent present).
  - **Example**: “Your private parts are special, and no one should touch them. If anyone tries, you should say ‘No,’ move away, and tell an adult.”

### **Conversation 3: “Respect and Affection”**
- **Media Basics**: Explain that some shows, movies, and games are for adults and not appropriate for children.
  - **Example**: “Some TV shows are made for grown-ups and might have things that are too confusing or scary for kids. That’s why we watch shows that are just right for you.”

- **Supervision**: Let your child know you will help them choose what’s best to watch and play.
  - **Example**: “There are fun shows and games for you, and I’ll help make sure we pick the ones that are safe.”

- **Family Diversity**: Teach that families come in all shapes and sizes—some have two moms, some have two dads, and some live with grandparents or other caregivers.
  - **Example**: “Every family is different, and that’s a good thing! Some families have two moms or two dads, and some have a mom and a dad. All families are special.”
