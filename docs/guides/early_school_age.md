## **Early School Age (Ages 6-8)**

### **Conversation 1: “Understanding Conception and Birth”**
- **Conception and Birth**: Offer more detailed explanations about reproduction.
  - **Example**: “When a sperm from the dad meets an egg from the mom, it can create a baby. The baby grows inside the uterus for about nine months until it’s ready to be born.”

- **Sexual Pleasure**: Introduce the idea that people sometimes have sex because it feels good and can bring them closer together, not just to make babies.
  - **Example**: “Sometimes, grown-ups have sex because it feels good to be close to someone they care about.”

- **Safe Touch**: Reinforce the concept of safe and unsafe touch and what they should do if someone touches them inappropriately.
  - **Example**: “It’s okay for a doctor to check you, but if someone touches you in a way that feels wrong or makes you uncomfortable, you should tell me or another adult you trust.”

### **Conversation 2: “Trusting Yourself and Understanding Secrets”**
- **Understanding Secrets**: Differentiate between good secrets (like surprise parties) and bad secrets (things that make you uncomfortable).
  - **Example**: “A good secret is something fun, like a surprise party. But a bad secret is something that makes you feel uncomfortable or scared. You should always tell someone about a bad secret.”

- **Trust Your Feelings**: Encourage them to trust their feelings and instincts.
  - **Example**: “If something feels off or uncomfortable, you should listen to those feelings and tell me about it. Your feelings are important.”

- **Reporting Concerns**: Reiterate the importance of speaking to an adult if they feel unsafe or if someone asks them to keep a bad secret.
  - **Example**: “If someone asks you to keep a bad secret or if something happens that makes you feel bad, always come to me. I will help you.”

### **Conversation 3: “Gender, Identity, and Healthy Relationships”**
- **Gender and Identity Basics**: Introduce the concept of gender identities and sexual orientations in a simple, accepting way.
  - **Example**: “Some people feel like they’re a boy, some feel like they’re a girl, and some feel a little different. It’s all okay, and everyone’s feelings matter.”

- **Inclusion**: Encourage a positive, inclusive attitude toward all people, regardless of gender or identity.
  - **Example**: “We should always be kind to others, no matter who they love or how they feel about their gender. Everyone deserves respect.”

- **Healthy Relationships**: Start discussing the idea that relationships are built on respect, trust, and caring for each other, whether they’re friendships or romantic relationships.
  - **Example**: “A healthy friendship or relationship means both people care about each other and treat each other with kindness and respect.”
